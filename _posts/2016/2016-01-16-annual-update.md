### Opening thoughts :)

The organizers for the SanDiego.js Community did something different at the beginning of this year. We got together for a kick-off meeting to talk about what we did in 2015, and what our goals are for 2016. In hindsight, I don't now why we haven't done this before.

We have a lot of great changes in store for this year and always welcome feedback. So please take the time to look over our ideas, and share your thoughts in the comments!

### 2015 introduced a lot of change to the SanDiego.js Community

* We built a [solid group of organizers](http://sandiegojs.org/about.html) that are dedicated to the community and nurturing the technology scene in San Diego
* We said goodbye to one of the original organizers of our community.
* We introduced lightning talks and increased attendance at our events.
* We moved from a long-time venue host to our new venue host [Zeeto](//zeeto.io).
* We currated over [50 videos on our Youtube channel!](https://www.youtube.com/user/SanDiegoJS)
* We added a [Code of Conduct](http://sandiegojs.org/code-of-conduct.html).
* We made great connections with code schools and companies in San Diego

### 2016 is about the community

As an ambitious group of organizers (and members) we have very ambitious goals for the year ahead! 

* We are more than just a meetup group, we are a community of developers that want to learn, challenge ourselves, and meet others like us. We want to embody the name **"SanDiego.js Community"** this year and be more than just a meetup.

* We want to connect with other communities and build a lasting partnership where we can help each other. We also think this will help increase diversity within the group and provide even more resources to you.

* We want **your** help! We want you to be more involved and feel like you have had a hand in helping nurture the community. Reach out to us to find out more, but I'm sure you'll be hearing us talk about this in the coming months at our events.

* Your feedback is extremely important to us and we are going to solicit for it more this year. We want this to be a great community for everyone involved! Have any thoughts on this? You are always welcome to [email me personally](mailto:h.a.brysiewicz@gmail.com). We value your ideas, praises, and even criticisms.

* We are going to keep doing primarily lightning talks at our main events. However, we would like to provide more technical talks each quarter. We also are interested in doing a "RE:talk" event on Saturdays where we invite prior speakers to give their talk **again**. Having a weekend event may be easier for some members to attend, and it gives the speakers another opportunity to work on their skills.

* We are looking into becoming a non-profit organization. We are not one yet, surprisingly, but as we continue to do more community outreach, we believe it is an important step in the development of our group.

* We want to get more SDJS swag in the hands of our members! We want it too :P

* We are going to continue connecting with companies and organizations in San Diego that want to be more involved or sponsor. Right now we don't offer very many sponsorship opportunities outside of venue hosting and food/drink for events, but we are compiling a prospective for any interested companies or organizations.

* We've better outlined what each of the organizer's roles are. The hope is that by each of us having a focus, we can be a better catalyst for members in the certain areas.

### Closing thoughts

We are really proud of how much we have grown this past year, and of all the great feedback we got from developers of all experience levels. We value your feedback and hope to get more of it. We want to make this year about you, and about the tech community in San Diego.

#### Thank you so much for being an active member, organization, or company involved in the making of this community. We wouldn't be here without you ðŸ’•
